## Using Sveltekit

I am using sveltekit to build my webapp. Sveltekit is similar to next.js, but it is faster and more lightweight.

### Running the app

To be able to run svelte kit apps, you need to download all the packages with your favorite Package manager like npm, yarn or pnpm.

After that you have to use the command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or:

```shell
pnpm dev
```

After that the app should be running on http://localhost:3000.

## First app

The first app specified in the given task can be found in the folder [Internals_1](https://github.com/HTW-Berlin-Vincent-Dlugosch/Webentwicklung/tree/main/internals_1).
